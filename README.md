# Shap-E-local
The code to run shap-e text-to-3d sample code locally.  
The original code is available at (https://github.com/openai/shap-e/blob/main/shap_e/examples/sample_text_to_3d.ipynb)

## Why I make this project?
One nice thing about being able to run code locally is that 3D models can be generated without an Internet connection.  
  
For this reason, I created this project as a sample for those who want to generate 3D models offline, or for those who are looking for a place to boast their ample GPU power.  

## Demo
I imported the 3D models generated by the following prompts into Blender and rendered them:  
- an apple
- a shark
- a table

The walls and the floor is blender's built-in plane object.
